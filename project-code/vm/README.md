# Setting up a four-node BigchainDB virtual machine network

Run `make install` to call the `stack.sh` script provided with the
official distribution of BigchainDB. This method is error prone (the install
process has to be run multiple times before each node is able to connect).
It has been included here only to document that I made a failed attempt to
use it for this project.
