# Data files for BigchainDB Role-Based Access Control Demo

- `ocm05084045.xml` represents an original MARC-format record from the
[Indiana University Library
catalog](https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/8251671)

- `gutenberg-iul-item.rdf` provides an example of a partial conversion
of the original MARC record to the BIBFRAME model using the RDF/XML
serialization 
    
- remaining files represent the data used to create assets for storage
in BigchainDB, converted from RDF/XML to JSON-LD
